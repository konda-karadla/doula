## 🐛 If You See Errors

### "Unmatched route" Error
**I just fixed this!** The app.json and _layout.tsx are updated.

**Try:**
```bash
# Stop the server (Ctrl+C if running)
# Start with cleared cache:
npm run start:clean
# Then press 'w'
```

### "Cannot find module"
**Fix:**
```bash
# Clear Metro cache
npx expo start -c
```
