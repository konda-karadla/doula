## 📝 Technical Notes

### Animation Performance
- All animations use `useNativeDriver: true` for GPU acceleration
- Stagger delays are optimized (50ms between items)
- Spring animations use optimal tension/friction values

### Search Implementation
- Uses `useMemo` for efficient filtering
- Filters multiple fields (filename, status, title, description)
- Case-insensitive search
- Debounced for performance

### State Management
- Settings persist to AsyncStorage
- Zustand stores manage global state
- React Query handles server state
- Local component state for UI only

### Accessibility
- All interactive elements have labels
- Proper roles for buttons/links
- Hints for complex interactions
- Screen reader tested
