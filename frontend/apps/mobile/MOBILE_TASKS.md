## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Monorepo Benefits:**
   - Shared types automatically sync
   - Shared API client reduces code duplication
   - Single source of truth for data models
   - Atomic commits across platforms

2. **Common Pitfalls to Avoid:**
   - Not configuring Metro properly for monorepo
   - Forgetting to clear Metro cache (`npx expo start -c`)
   - Hardcoding API URLs (use environment variables)
   - Not testing on physical devices
   - Ignoring performance on low-end devices

3. **Best Practices:**
   - Always use shared types from `@health-platform/types`
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Add loading states for all async operations
   - Test offline functionality thoroughly
   - Keep bundle size minimal
   - Use proper TypeScript types (avoid `any`)

## 🚀 Next Steps (Phase 7 Priority)

### Immediate Priority: Backend Integration (2-3 hours)
1. **Configure API Client for Production**
   - Update API base URL in `packages/api-client/src/client.ts`
   - Test connection to local NestJS backend (http://localhost:3000)
   - Set up environment variables for prod/dev

2. **Connect Real Endpoints**
   - [ ] Test authentication endpoints (already working)
   - [ ] Connect Lab Results to `/labs` API
   - [ ] Connect Action Plans to `/action-plans` API
   - [ ] Connect Health Score to `/insights/health-score` API
   - [ ] Connect Profile Stats to real user data

3. **Remove Mock Data**
   - [ ] Replace `__mocks__` with real API calls
   - [ ] Test error scenarios with real backend
   - [ ] Test loading states with network delays
   - [ ] Verify offline behavior

4. **End-to-End Testing**
   - [ ] Test complete user flows
   - [ ] Verify data persistence
   - [ ] Test error recovery
   - [ ] Test token refresh

### Secondary Priority: Deployment Preparation (1-2 hours)
1. **App Assets**
   - [ ] Create app icon (1024x1024)
   - [ ] Create splash screen
   - [ ] Take app screenshots
   - [ ] Update app.json metadata

2. **Build Configuration**
   - [ ] Set up EAS Build
   - [ ] Configure iOS bundle identifier
   - [ ] Configure Android package name
   - [ ] Test production builds

3. **App Store Submission**
   - [ ] Create iOS app listing
   - [ ] Create Android app listing
   - [ ] Submit for review

### Optional Enhancements (Future)
- [ ] Camera integration for lab uploads
- [ ] Push notifications
- [ ] Deep linking
- [ ] Share functionality
- [ ] Calendar integration
