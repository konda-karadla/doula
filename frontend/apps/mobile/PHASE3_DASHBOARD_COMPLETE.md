## 🚀 What's Working

- ✅ Shows empty state when no data
- ✅ Pull-to-refresh reloads data
- ✅ Color-coded health status
- ✅ Trend indicators

**Lab Results:**

## 🎯 Next Steps

**If no data shows:**
- That's normal! Backend probably has no data for your user
- Empty states look good and guide users
- Later: Add upload/create functionality

**To add real data:**
- Use the web app or admin panel to add labs/plans
- Or we can build the upload/create screens next
