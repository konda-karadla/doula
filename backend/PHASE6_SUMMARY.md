### 5. Recommendation Examples

#### Blood Sugar Management
**Low Glucose (< 70 mg/dL):**
> Your blood glucose is low. Consider eating a small snack with carbohydrates. If this persists, consult your healthcare provider.

**High Glucose (> 100 mg/dL):**
> Your blood glucose is elevated. Consider reducing sugar intake, increasing physical activity, and monitoring regularly.

**Normal Glucose (70-100 mg/dL):**
> Your glucose levels are within optimal range. Maintain a balanced diet and regular exercise.

#### Cholesterol Management
**High LDL (> 100 mg/dL):**
> Your LDL cholesterol is high. Reduce saturated fats, increase fiber intake, and consider discussing medication with your doctor.

**Low HDL (< 40 mg/dL):**
> Your HDL cholesterol is low. Increase aerobic exercise, quit smoking if applicable, and eat healthy fats.

**High Triglycerides (> 150 mg/dL):**
> Your triglycerides are elevated. Limit sugar and refined carbs, increase omega-3 fatty acids, and exercise regularly.

#### Vitamin & Mineral Support
**Low Vitamin D (< 30 ng/mL):**
> Your vitamin D is low. Increase sun exposure, eat vitamin D-rich foods, or consider supplementation (2000-4000 IU daily).

**Low Hemoglobin (< 12.0 g/dL):**
> Your hemoglobin is low, indicating possible anemia. Increase iron-rich foods and consult your doctor.

#### Thyroid Health
**High TSH (> 4.0 mIU/L):**
> Your TSH is elevated, which may indicate hypothyroidism. Discuss thyroid supplementation with your healthcare provider.

**Low TSH (< 0.4 mIU/L):**
