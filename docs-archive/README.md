# 📦 Archived Documentation

This directory contains documentation files that have been archived but may still be useful for reference.

## 📋 Archived Files

### Backend Documentation
- **E2E_TEST_REPORT.md** - End-to-end test results and coverage reports
- **PHASE4_REQUIREMENTS.md** - Detailed Phase 4 specifications and requirements
- **LOCAL_SETUP_GUIDE.md** - Development environment setup guide

## 🔍 Why These Files Were Archived

These files were moved to archive because:
1. **E2E_TEST_REPORT.md** - Test reports are time-sensitive and can be regenerated
2. **PHASE4_REQUIREMENTS.md** - Phase 4 is complete, requirements are now in implementation docs
3. **LOCAL_SETUP_GUIDE.md** - Setup instructions are covered in main README files

## 📚 Accessing Archived Documentation

To access archived documentation:
1. Check the main documentation first in the root directory
2. If you need specific historical details, refer to these archived files
3. For current setup instructions, use the main README files

## 🗑️ Cleanup Policy

Archived files will be reviewed quarterly and may be removed if:
- Information is outdated and superseded by current documentation
- Files are no longer referenced by active development
- Storage space becomes a concern
