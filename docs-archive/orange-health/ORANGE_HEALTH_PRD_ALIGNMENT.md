## 🎯 UPDATED QUESTIONS FOR YOUR PRD CONTEXT

### Add These 3 Questions to Your Call:

### 🔴 QUESTION 11: Fertility-Specific Tests (CRITICAL FOR YOUR USERS!)

**Ask:**
> "Our platform focuses heavily on fertility care and preconception optimization. What fertility-specific tests do you offer? Do you have comprehensive fertility panels for couples?"

**Why Critical for Your PRD:**
- 🎯 Persona 2 (Future Parents) is a primary target
- 🎯 Fertility tests are your differentiation
- 🎯 Need specialized tests beyond basic health markers

**Ideal Answer:**
```json
{
  "female_fertility_panel": {
    "tests": ["AMH", "FSH", "LH", "Estradiol", "Progesterone", "Prolactin", "TSH"],
    "price": 3500,
    "at_home": true,
    "fasting": false
  },

---

### Your Biomarker Scoring Engine + Orange Health Data

**Phase 2 Goal (from PRD):** "Advanced scoring engines"

**With Structured Orange Health Data:**
```javascript
// Calculate fertility readiness score
const calculateFertilityScore = (biomarkers) => {
  let score = 100;
  
  // Female factors
  if (biomarkers.amh < 1.0) score -= 20; // Low ovarian reserve
  if (biomarkers.tsh > 4.0) score -= 15; // Thyroid issue
  if (biomarkers.vitamin_d < 30) score -= 10;
  if (biomarkers.iron < 40) score -= 10;
  
  // Male factors
  if (biomarkers.sperm_count < 15) score -= 25;
  if (biomarkers.testosterone < 300) score -= 15;
  
  return {
    score,
    category: score > 80 ? 'Excellent' : score > 60 ? 'Good' : 'Needs Attention',
    recommendations: generateRecommendations(biomarkers)
  };
};
```

**This only works with structured data from Orange Health!**
