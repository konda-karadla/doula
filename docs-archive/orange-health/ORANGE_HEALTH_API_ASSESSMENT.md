## üß™ API Testing Results

### Test 1: Serviceability Check ‚úÖ
**Endpoint:** `GET /v1/partner/serviceability`

**Test Location:** Koramangala, Bengaluru (12.93922, 77.62539)

**Results:**
- **Status:** Location is serviceable

- **Tomorrow (Oct 10):** 16 slots available (morning/afternoon/evening)
- **Slot Types:** Morning (6:00 AM - 12:00 PM), Afternoon (3:30 PM - 6:00 PM), Evening (7:00 PM - 9:30 PM)

**Sample Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "Location is serviceable",
  "slots": {
    "2025-10-09T15:30:00": {
      "slot_datetime": "2025-10-09T15:30:00",
      "is_morning_slot": false,

## üìä Orange Health API Capabilities (Based on Documentation)

### 1. **Serviceability Check** ‚úÖ TESTED
- Check if location is serviceable
- Get available time slots
- Filter by date

### 2. **Test Catalog** ‚ùì NEEDS CLARIFICATION
- List available tests
- Get test details (name, description, preparation)
- Browse test packages/panels
- Get pricing information

**Questions for Orange Health:**
- What endpoint provides the test catalog?
- How do we get test IDs for order creation?
- Are prices included in test details?
- How often does the catalog update?

### 3. **Order Creation** üìù DOCUMENTED
**Endpoint:** `POST /v1/partner/order`

**Expected Payload:**
```json
{
  "customer": {
    "name": "Patient Name",
    "mobile": "9876543210",
    "email": "patient@example.com",
    "age": 30,
    "gender": "male"
  },
  "address": {
    "line1": "Full address",
    "latitude": 12.93922,
    "longitude": 77.62539,
    "pincode": "560034"
  },
  "slot_datetime": "2025-10-10T08:30:00",
  "tests": ["TEST_ID_1", "TEST_ID_2"],
  "payment_mode": "online"
}
```

**Questions for Orange Health:**
- What is the response structure? (Order ID, confirmation details)
- How do we get test IDs?
- What payment modes are supported? (online, cod, prepaid)
- Is there a payment gateway integration needed?
- Can we get test cost in response before payment?
- Is there a dry-run/validate order endpoint?

### 4. **Order Status Tracking** üìù DOCUMENTED
**Endpoint:** `GET /v1/partner/order/{order_id}/status`

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "order_id": "ORG123456",
  "status": "sample_collected",
  "phlebotomist": {
    "name": "Phlebotomist Name",
    "phone": "9876543210"
  },
  "estimated_result_time": "2025-10-10T18:00:00"
}
```

**Possible Statuses:**
- `confirmed` - Order placed successfully
- `phlebotomist_assigned` - Technician assigned
- `en_route` - Technician on the way
- `sample_collected` - Sample collected from patient
- `processing` - Sample at lab

- Can we track phlebotomist location in real-time?
- Is there a separate endpoint for phlebotomist tracking?

### 5. **Test Results Retrieval** ‚ùì NEEDS CLARIFICATION
**Endpoint:** `GET /v1/partner/order/{order_id}/results`

**Questions for Orange Health:**
- What format are results provided? (PDF, JSON, both?)
- Do you provide structured biomarker data (JSON)?
- Example response structure?
- Are reference ranges included?
- Do you provide historical results for a patient?
- Can we download PDF reports?

### 6. **Webhooks for Real-Time Updates** üîî CRITICAL
**Purpose:** Get real-time notifications without polling

**Questions for Orange Health:**

### 7. **Order Management** ‚ùì NEEDS CLARIFICATION
**Potential Endpoints:**
- `PUT /v1/partner/order/{order_id}/reschedule` - Reschedule appointment
- `DELETE /v1/partner/order/{order_id}/cancel` - Cancel order
- `POST /v1/partner/order/{order_id}/addon` - Add tests to existing order

**Questions for Orange Health:**
- What is the reschedule policy? (how many hours before?)
- What is the cancellation policy? (refund terms?)
- Can tests be added after order creation?
- Are there any penalties for cancellation?

### 8. **Camp Orders** ‚ùì NEEDS CLARIFICATION
**For bulk/corporate bookings**

**Questions for Orange Health:**
- What is a "camp order"?
- Use cases for our platform?
- Different pricing for bulk orders?
- Minimum order quantities?

---

## üèóÔ∏è Current System Architecture

### Your Existing Lab Results System:

```typescript
LabResult {
  id: UUID
  userId: UUID
  systemId: UUID
  fileName: string
  s3Key: string
  s3Url: string
  uploadedAt: DateTime
  processingStatus: "pending" | "processing" | "completed" | "failed"
  rawOcrText: string?
  biomarkers: Biomarker[]
}

Biomarker {
  id: UUID
  labResultId: UUID
  testName: string
  value: string
  unit: string?
  referenceRangeLow: string?
  referenceRangeHigh: string?
  testDate: DateTime?
  notes: string?
}
```

**Current Flow:**
1. User uploads PDF lab report
2. System stores PDF in S3
3. OCR extracts text from PDF
4. Parser extracts biomarkers
5. Users view biomarkers and insights

**Gap:** No ability to **order** lab tests - only upload existing results

---

## ‚úÖ Integration Recommendations

### Phase 1: Basic Integration (Week 1-2)

#### 1. **Database Schema Updates**

Add new table for Orange Health orders:

```sql
CREATE TABLE lab_orders (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID NOT NULL,
  system_id UUID NOT NULL,
  
  -- Orange Health Details
  orange_health_order_id VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE,
  
  -- Order Details
  tests JSONB NOT NULL, -- Array of test IDs and names
  total_amount DECIMAL(10,2),
  payment_mode VARCHAR(50),
  payment_status VARCHAR(50),
  
  -- Patient Details
  patient_name VARCHAR(255),
  patient_mobile VARCHAR(20),
  patient_email VARCHAR(255),
  patient_age INTEGER,
  patient_gender VARCHAR(20),
  
  -- Address Details
  address_line1 TEXT,
  address_latitude DECIMAL(10,8),
  address_longitude DECIMAL(11,8),
  address_pincode VARCHAR(10),
  
  -- Appointment Details
  scheduled_slot TIMESTAMP,
  slot_type VARCHAR(20), -- morning, afternoon, evening
  
  -- Status Tracking
  order_status VARCHAR(50), -- confirmed, sample_collected, completed, etc.
  phlebotomist_name VARCHAR(255),
  phlebotomist_phone VARCHAR(20),
  estimated_result_time TIMESTAMP,
  
  -- Result Linking
  lab_result_id UUID, -- Link to lab_results table when results arrive
  
  -- Timestamps
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  
  FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (system_id) REFERENCES systems(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (lab_result_id) REFERENCES lab_results(id)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_lab_orders_user ON lab_orders(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_lab_orders_system ON lab_orders(system_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_lab_orders_status ON lab_orders(order_status);
CREATE INDEX idx_lab_orders_orange ON lab_orders(orange_health_order_id);
```

Add status tracking table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE lab_order_status_history (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  lab_order_id UUID NOT NULL,
  status VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  notes TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  
  FOREIGN KEY (lab_order_id) REFERENCES lab_orders(id)
);
```

#### 2. **New Backend Modules**

**Module: Lab Orders** (`src/lab-orders/`)

Services needed:
- `OrangeHealthService` - API integration layer

DELETE /api/lab-orders/{orderId}

// 10. Webhook receiver (Orange Health -> Your system)
POST /api/webhooks/orange-health
Body: { order_id, status, ... }
```

#### 3. **Orange Health Service Implementation**

```typescript
// src/lab-orders/services/orange-health.service.ts
@Injectable()
export class OrangeHealthService {
  private readonly apiKey = process.env.ORANGE_HEALTH_API_KEY;
  private readonly baseUrl = process.env.ORANGE_HEALTH_BASE_URL;
  
  async checkServiceability(lat: number, lng: number, date: string) {
    // Call Orange Health API
  }
  
  async getAvailableTests() {
    // Get test catalog
  }
  
  async createOrder(orderData: CreateOrderDto) {
    // Create order via Orange Health API
    // Return order ID and confirmation
  }
  
  async getOrderStatus(orangeOrderId: string) {
    // Get current status
  }
  
  async getOrderResults(orangeOrderId: string) {
    // Fetch results (PDF + structured data if available)
  }
  
  async rescheduleOrder(orangeOrderId: string, newSlot: string) {
    // Reschedule appointment
  }
  
  async cancelOrder(orangeOrderId: string) {
    // Cancel order
  }
}
```

#### 4. **Environment Variables**

Add to `.env`:
```env
